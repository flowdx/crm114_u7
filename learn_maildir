# This script will look for a system user's primary maildir
# $HOME/Maildir and possible vMailMgr maildirs under $HOME/users/
# and search them for folders indicating a certain setup:
#
# \
#  \___ Inbox
#   \
#    \___ Spam
#     \
#      \___ als Ham lernen
#      |
#      |___ als Spam lernen
#
# If it finds this folder structure in any maildir, it will show
# files from the folders 'als Ham lernen' and 'als Spam lernen' to CRM114
# (so it can learn) and after that it will delete them.
#
# You can make this script more verbose with '-v'.
#
# You can also test this script with '-n' in dry run mode. If combined
# with '-v' it will output what it would have done, but won't do any-
# thing.
